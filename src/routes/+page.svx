# Hi, I'm Ava! 👋

I'm a games and software developer, focused on programming, design, and systems. Much of my work is housed under my studio, [Loneka](https://loneka.com) (100B Sess.), which produces leading tools for game developers. I've also worked with [HD Admin](/work/hd-admin) (100B+ Sess.), and friends and contributors globally.

I'm also a middle school dropout, due to personal reasons. I'm now pursuing an education, discovering its myriad benefits along with its heavy bureaucracy. Suffice it to say, I don't believe in absolutes. For me, passionate exploration is greater.

When I'm not working or studying, I love spending time with friends, walking, and going out to events! I also enjoy thinking about design in a broader sense, and how that shapes aspects of the world around us.

Proud member of [UW GDC](/work/uw-gdc) and [Socratica](https://socratica.info).
