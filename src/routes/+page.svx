# Hi, I'm Ava!

I'm a games & software developer, focused on programming and design. Much of my work is housed under my studio, [Loneka](https://loneka.com), which produces leading tools for game developers, alongside in-house titles.

When I'm not working or studying, I love spending time with friends, walking, and reading! I also enjoy experimenting with web and app technologies, and rewriting this website whenever I get bored of it. *(oops)*
