## Quality components 🧩

Build quality UI faster with dozens of hand-crafted components. Everything is fully typed, so you can spend more time making UI instead of reading the docs.

##  Comprehensive theming 🎨

Style *all* components into the look and feel you desire with OnyxUI's dynamic theming system. Base values propagate into proportional scales, enforcing consistency with ease.

## Styling, now *not* stupid 🖌️

Messy markup sucks. Style any component, with as little as half the code, using passthrough styling props. You can even create compound styles, like gradient strokes.
