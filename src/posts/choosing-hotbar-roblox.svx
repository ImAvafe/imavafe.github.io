At some point in development, you very well might want to replace Roblox's hotbar with something more suitable. Let's face it, it's old. If you value style and cross-platform support, this guide is for you.

# [Satchel](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/satchel-open-source-modern-backpack-system/2451549)

Satchel excels as an 'exact' replacement for the default hotbar, supporting the inventory system much like Roblox does it, with near-identically designed interactions. Its UI is easy to customize, but limited in flexibility.

# [NeoHotbar](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/neohotbar-a-modern-customizable-backpack/2738850)

NeoHotbar takes a heavier twist on things, reimagining the hotbar's core design and interactions. It doesn't limit the items you can have handy, reducing the need for a built-in inventory. The UI is completely overridable, but requires more development knowledge.

# Making your own

Maybe you've taken a look at the other two, and they just aren't quite flexible enough. You can make your own! Both [NeoHotbar](https://github.com/ImAvafe/NeoHotbar) and [Satchel](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/satchel-open-source-modern-backpack-system/2451549) are fully open source, meaning you can take what they've learned, and apply them to your own implementation.

For building out UIs, I recommend [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion) and [OnyxUI](https://github.com/loneka/onyx-ui) personally.
